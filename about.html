        <h2>Tom Hacker</h2>
        <p>Hello, i am Tom Hacker! that is my real name...</p>

        <p>I have always been extremely involved with tech and do enjoy wasting long hours into the night learning about the latest tech.</p>
        <p>I *was* also a professional musician for around 2 years after i aqquired a degree in professinoal musicianship.</p>
        <p>I decided to build my own Midi Controller as i couldnt find an affordable product which ticked all the boxes for me. The end product looked like shit, but my gosh did it work. That took me months, because i really did not understand how to code, i would spend many late nights trying to produce results that eventually came. The feeling i would get in those moments sparked my passion for engineering tech.</p>
        <p>i then discovered the amazing MERN stack, which moved me away from music and towards technological development as a whole.</p>
        <p>a year later in 2022, i joined futureproof. i will never look back, as tech development has gripped me in a way that even guitar / music never did.</p>
        <p>I enjoy every single aspect of tech development, from design to testing, i cannot go an hour without riffing on my laptop or taking notes on my phone about silly ideas to try or concepts to research later on when i am away from the moguls.</p>
